# A Wolf Cries: Private Collection of Intimate Writings

Welcome to a deeply personal collection of short stories, reflections, and narrative fragments—written across seasons of heartbreak, solitude, growth, and spiritual reckoning. These works are not polished for publication; they are raw, intentional, and honest.

## ✍️ About This Repository

This archive presents a curated selection of my most intimate literary works, written to explore themes such as:

- Fractured relationships  
- Identity and resilience  
- Loss, memory, and redemption  
- Spiritual struggle and awakening  
- Emotional survival in silence  

Some stories are complete. Others remain unfinished—yet whole in what they reveal.

## 🎯 Intended Use

This repository is intended as part of a creative/editorial portfolio for junior editorial roles. It highlights:

- Stylistic range (flash fiction, poetic prose, serialized thriller)  
- Editorial judgment and self-review capability  
- Emotional and thematic depth in writing
