# A Wolf Cries: Private Collection of Intimate Writings

Welcome to a deeply personal collection of short stories, reflections, and narrative fragments. These works were written across seasons of solitude, growth, heartbreak, and spiritual reckoning. They are not polished for public consumption—they are raw, intentional, and honest.

## ✍️ About This Repository

This repository serves as a curated archive of some of my most intimate literary works. Each piece explores themes such as:
- Fractured relationships
- Identity and resilience
- Loss, memory, and redemption
- Spiritual struggle and awakening
- Emotional survival in silence

Some stories are complete. Others are fragments—unfinished, yet whole in what they reveal.
