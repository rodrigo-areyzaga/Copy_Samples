# A Wolf Cries: Private Collection of Intimate Writings

Welcome to a deeply personal collection of short stories, reflections, and narrative fragments. These works were written across seasons of solitude, growth, heartbreak, and spiritual reckoning. They are not polished for public consumption—they are raw, intentional, and honest.

## ✍️ About This Repository

This repository serves as a curated archive of my most intimate literary works. Each piece explores themes such as:
- Fractured relationships
- Identity and resilience
- Loss, memory, and redemption
- Spiritual struggle and awakening
- Emotional survival in silence

Some stories are complete. Others are fragments—unfinished, yet whole in what they reveal.

## 🔐 Access & Ethics

This is a **private repository** shared with a trusted circle. If you’re reading this, you’ve been granted access not for critique or commercial use, but for presence. Please read with care, and respond—if you choose to—not as an editor, but as a fellow human being.

## 📂 Structure

Each story is stored as a separate `.md` or `.txt` file with the date of origin where possible. Some may include editorial notes or revision drafts.
